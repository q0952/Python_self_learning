# Milestones_of_Python_self_learning
Recording my learning steps. Inside this repository are codes from my self-learning work. For documenting and sharing if someone else need it as well.

Uploaded: "Ackermann.py". This is a classic recurtion function, improve my concept of recurse order in python.

Uploaded: "concept_of_return_value.py", "distance_and_circle_area.py", "boolean_value.py", "factorial_with_checking_code.py". Weekeng is even more better for doing some research, , which I have done a lot today. Rename this repo to Python_self_learning, for the log of my learning progress. As title, In this file I found the different and concept of return value, change some of my view. Next part I got a skill of coding nestly, which is coded in file "distance_and circle_area.py". Realize by the "factorial_with_checking_code.py" file, if you are dealing with a big project, always handle the concept first, and do it with incremental development, do it small then stick them together. Always using the "print" order to monitorthe value your function return, key-in few more words but keep things easier, don't forget to take them down after the code is done to keep your code clean and readable BTW.

Uploaded: "epoch_to_now.py", "Koch_curve.py", "Koch_snowflake.py". I got myself a push-up in this little exercise. Before this lesson, I did things slowly and standardly, never think about that I should observe and watch carefully then figure out which part of the program is reuseable, thus I can do it with loop orders in python. Such like "Koch_ï¼£urve.py", the original version is not smart, I do things listly without loop-order. I realized that if I can combine the "for" loop-order and list, things and be done repeatly so easy. BTW, drawing picture by Python's turtle module is really fun.

This "README.md" file is created.
Uploaded:  "turtle_flower.py", "turtle_circle.py". Creat my first Github account, and found lots of useful information here, grateful for everything.
Learned and skilled how to draw picture by the module of turtle in Python, makes my programing life fun more.

Uploaded: "backup_ver4.py". My first app is made weekly ago. Though it looks bit of simple, but one step foward is always better than doing nothing.
