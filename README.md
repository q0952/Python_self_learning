My first app is made weekly ago. Though it looks bit of simple, but one step foward is always better than doing nothing.

I got myself a push-up in this little exercise. Before this lesson, I did things slowly and standardly, never think about that I should observe and watch carefully then figure out which part of the program is reuseable, thus I can do it with loop orders in python. Such like "Koch_ï¼£urve.py", the original version is not smart, I do things listly without loop-order. I realized that if I can combine the "for" loop-order and list, things and be done repeatly so easy. BTW, drawing picture by Python's turtle module is really fun.
